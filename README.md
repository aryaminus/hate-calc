# Hate Calculator:
A Hybrid App which takes 2 names and calculates the Hate Percentage.
It is developed using Ionic / Angular Framework and basically uses the approach of a basic Love Calculator.

# Usage:
A user can input two names or extract a contact name from the cellphone (Android N asks for permission). Then the 2 names are converted using charCodeAt and then the sum is divided by 101% giving a value 50 < X < 100
